# Tornado Alley
### Brackeys Game Jam 2021.2 : Let there be Chaos

Tornado Alley was built in seven days for Brackeys Game Jam 2021.2

The theme of the game jam was "Let there be Chaos." At first, much like everyone else, our theme idea started off as "bullet hell" but that's just way too common. We decided to flip the script a bit and make the player spread chaos. That led to the idea of having the player be a storm going around destroying things, so naturally we picked a tornado.

In this game you will control a tornado and target houses to spread chaos and destruction. Pick up debris and trees to increase your size and power.

Be warned! If you get too big you need much more power to move, but if you get too small, having too much power will make you lose control.

Get as many points as possible, and survive until the timer runs out.
